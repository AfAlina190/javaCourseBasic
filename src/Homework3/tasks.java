/*Task 1: Write a program that dis plays information about you (or a fictional character) on the screen in three lines:

            "My name is ..."
            "I am ... years old."
            "I am from ..."

    Data that has been previously written to variables must be used in place of the dots!*/



    /*Task 2: Declare 10 variables of int type with values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Declare one more int variable and store in it the sum of these variables divided by 10. You will have the arithmetic mean of these numbers in one variable. Print it out using println. How much did the program discard in the fractional part?

    Problem 3: Let the price of product A is usually 1000 rubles and product B is 500 rubles. If the client buys the goods together, they have a discount of 100 rubles for the entire purchase. Print the variable that corresponds to the value of the sum A + B with the discount. Separately display the amount of the discount from this purchase.

            Task 4. Find on the Internet data on the temperature in your city for the past week. Calculate the average temperature for the week and print it.

            Task 5. What numbers can be obtained as a remainder from dividing an integer by 2? By 3? Show it with concrete examples.

    WHEN PERFORMING THESE TASKS, TRY TO CREATE A SEPARATE SERVICE CLASS THAT WOULD CONTAIN A SEPARATE METHOD(S) TO PERFORM A SMALL INDEPENDENT TASK (FOR EXAMPLE, CALCULATING THE ARITHMETIC MEAN).
